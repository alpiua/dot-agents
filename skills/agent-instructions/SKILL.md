# Agent Instructions

## Boundaries

```text
~/.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md                reusable base procedure
<repository>/AGENTS.md                          router, commands, and guards
<repository>/.agents/skills/<name>/ADDON.md     optional repository add-on
<repository>/.acdd/<host>.yaml                 ACDD repository adapter
<repository>/**/AGENTS.md                       subtree-specific commands and invariants
<repository>/.agents/{skills,workflows}         repository-owned procedures and adapters
<repository>/docs/**                            contracts, architecture, and operational detail
```

## Routing Principle

Every shared skill is a base contract, not a workspace-specific workflow. The
repository that invokes it supplies its own add-on when local commands, tools,
evidence, or boundaries are required:

```text
user request
  -> repository AGENTS.md selects the shared skill
  -> shared SKILL.md establishes the reusable procedure
  -> optional .agents/skills/<skill>/ADDON.md supplies repository behavior
  -> nearest subtree AGENTS.md supplies narrower ownership rules
```

The add-on may add repository-specific routes, commands, tool adapters, evidence
locations, and stricter gates. It must not weaken the shared skill's safety,
authorization, or evidence requirements. Do not depend on an enclosing workspace
`AGENTS.md`: agents start from an individual Git repository.

`acdd-flow` is the exception to add-on routing: load repository policy from the
host-selected adapter under `.acdd/` (`.acdd/kilo.yaml` for Kilo). Do not create
`.agents/skills/acdd-flow/ADDON.md`.

## Write

1. Read the target repository root and nearest parent `AGENTS.md` files.
2. Put cross-repository topology only in the root `AGENTS.md`; put commands and
   non-negotiable rules with the repository or subtree that owns them.
3. Route reusable actions by global skill name, for example
   `close-review-findings` or `commit-workflow`. When the repository needs local
   behavior, route the skill to `.agents/skills/<skill>/ADDON.md` after loading
   the global base skill.
4. Give each rule one owner. Do not copy a workflow or a detailed contract into
   multiple `AGENTS.md` files.
5. Use imperative, copyable language: `Read`, `Run`, `Load`, `Use`, `Do not`.
6. Keep Markdown links repository-relative and valid from the file that owns
   them. Use a skill name rather than a filesystem link for `~/.agents` skills.
7. Keep one add-on per shared skill per repository. Do not create a local
   `SKILL.md` with the same name, because it can shadow the global base skill.

## Keep It Short

- Repository `AGENTS.md`: routes, commands, guards, and sibling-repository
  boundaries.
- Subtree `AGENTS.md`: only local rules that differ from the repository root.
- Workflow: ordered task steps and command gates.
- Skill: reusable tool selection, procedure, and validation.
- Docs: detailed contracts, schemas, rationale, and examples.

Do not write session history, migration history, product-specific detail in a
shared skill, unregistered tool names, or duplicate procedures.

## Validate

1. Resolve every repository-relative Markdown link changed by the edit.
2. Run the repository's instruction or layout checks when available.
3. Run the applicable Planner shape validator after Planner edits.
4. Run `git diff --check` from every changed Git repository.
